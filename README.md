# Gesture-Detection-
The code captures real-time video from the webcam and displays it in a window titled "Hand Gesture Recognition". If a hand is detected in the frame, landmarks (key points) are drawn on the hand. The code attempts to recognize a simple open hand palm gesture. If the thumb is below the palm and the index finger is extended, it recognizes this as a gesture to "Hello People".
